This is a tool for testing reaction times. It shows glyphs, cycling through colors. The task is to press a key once if (and only if) a glyph shown has the same shape as the preceding glyph.

Testing:
    ./pytest [seconds] > [filename]

Analysis:
    ./pytest_analyze < [filename]

The file format used contains tab separated UTF-8 text. The first
field contains the timestamp. The second field contains the type of
the record (“EVENT” or “SYMBOL”). The third field contains the event
(if the type is “EVENT”) or the symbol shown (if the type is
“SYMBOL”).
